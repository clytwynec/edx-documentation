******************************
Video Processing Overview
******************************

Videos are one of the most important assets of an online course. Making course
videos available to students who are located all over the world, and who are
accessing course content with different devices and Internet connectivity
constraints, can be a complex undertaking. To help course teams at partner
institutions meet the challenge of delivering high quality video experiences to
as many students as possible, edX offers video file processing and media
hosting services. Once these services are set up for your insititution and
course, course teams only need to upload a single file to Studio for each of
the videos they want to include in their course.

For a video to play at locations around the world, it needs to be available
from more than one host sites. For a video to play on different devices,
including both desktop computers and smart phones, it needs to be available in
several different formats.

The edX media team, with the assistance of a representative from our partner
institution, creates accounts with two file hosting services: YouTube Content
Management System (CMS) and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Before your course teams can begin to upload videos in Studio, you work with
the edX media team to make sure that these preparatory tasks are complete.

* :ref:`Establish Access to YouTube Account`

* :ref:`Set Up YouTube Channels`

After your course teams upload an original video file in .mp4 or .mov format in
Studio, an automated process begins to create additional formats and store them
for you, ready for students to access, with the hosting services.

.. important:: The tasks described in this section rely on the use of
 third-party tools and software. Because these tools are subject to change by
 their respective owners, the steps provided here are intended as
 guidelines and not as exact procedures.

.. _Identify Video Administrators:

****************************************
Identify Video Administrators
****************************************

At each edX partner institution, one person, or more often several people, need
to be identified as video administrators. The video administrators use the
YouTube Content Management System (CMS) periodically to complete these tasks.

* Set up a YouTube channel for each course. 

* Grant access privileges to each YouTube channel to members of the
  corresponding course team.

Video administrators may also, on occasion, work with members of the edX media
team and course teams to resolve questions about video files.

EdX recommends that organizations identify specific individuals as the video
administrators for all of your courses. By working with the edX team over
time, the video administrators can develop repeatable, consistent procedures
for managing your video assets.

.. _Establish Access to YouTube Account:

****************************************
Establish Access to YouTube Account 
****************************************

The edX video team creates a dedicated YouTube CMS account for each partner
institution. This account stores all of the video files for all of your
courses. Because access to the account is granted to email addresses, the edX
video team works with one of your video administrators to set up an email
address specifically for this purpose and give it administrative privileges.

.. note:: The edX media team adds the video files to the YouTube CMS account.

This procedure only needs to be completed once at each institution by one of the video administrators.

#. Create a single Google email "gmail" account. The recommended format for the
   account name is {institution ID}X-CMSmanager@gmail.com.

#. Send the email address to a member of the edX video team.

   On receipt, an edX video team member adds the gmail address to the YouTube
   account and gives the account administrative privileges. This process
   results in an activation message that is sent to the gmail account. Access
   to the CMS account is not provided until activation is complete.

3. Check the gmail account for the activation message from YouTube. These
   messages are typically routed to the gmail "Social" inbox.

#. To activate the account, click the "Visit the sign-up page" link in the
   email message. A browser opens to the YouTube signup page.

#. Click **Use existing Google account**. You can now access the CMS account.

All of the video administrators at an institution use the same gmail
account to log in to the YouTube CMS. This approach helps ensure that staffing
changes do not interrupt your institution's access to the YouTube account.

.. _Set Up YouTube Channels:

****************************************
Set Up YouTube Channels
****************************************

For each course that is offered by an institution, a video administrator
creates a YouTube "channel" to store that course's video files. A channel is,
essentially, a folder or directory that stores the video files that play on
YouTube. Organizing your institution's video files into channels by course
simplifies file delivery and management. YouTube collects analytics for each
channel that you create.

This procedure only needs to be completed once per course, but it must be
complete before the course team begins to add videos to the course in
Studio.

#. In your browser, access the YouTube Creator Studio by going to
   https://cms.youtube.com/.

#. Use the video administrators' {institution ID}X-CMSmanager@gmail.com address
   to log in to your institution's CMS account. The email address that you log
   in with is the owner of the channels that you create.

#. In the navigation bar at left click **CHANNELS**. A list of your
   institution's channels appears.

#. Above the list of channels click **Create New**. A popup window opens.

#. Leave the checkboxes under **Permissions** unselected, and then click
   **Continue**. (You can change the channel's permission settings at any
   time.) The popup window presents fields for information about the channel. 

#. Provide a channel name that clearly and uniquely identifies the course.
   Example channel names include Water201x and Foundations of Chinese Thought.

#. For the category, select **Company, Institution, or Organization**.

#. Agree to the terms and then click **Done**. The list of channels now
   includes the channel that you just set up.

You can now provide the YouTube channel ID to the edX video team when needed,
and give management access to the channel to members of the course team.

.. _Locate the YouTube Channel ID:

==============================
Locate the YouTube Channel ID
==============================

To store video files for a course in the correct YouTube channel, the edX video
team needs to know the ID for the course's YouTube channel. If necessary, video
administrators can locate this ID.

#. In your browser, access the YouTube Creator Studio by going to
   https://cms.youtube.com/.

#. Use the video administrators' {institution ID}X-CMSmanager@gmail.com address
   to log in to your institution's CMS account.

#. In the navigation bar at left click **CHANNELS**. A list of your
   institution's channels appears.

#. Click the name of the channel. The page refreshes in your browser.  

#. At top right, click the channel image. A window displays information about
   the account, including the email address that you used to log in.
   
#. Click the **YouTube settings** icon. The Account Settings Overview page
   opens in your browser.
	
#. Under the channel name, click **Advanced**. The YouTube Channel ID appears
   in the Account Information section of the page.

.. _Add a Channel Manager:

======================
Add a Channel Manager
======================

After the edX video team processes the video files that are uploaded to Studio
by a course team, the automated process that creates files in additional
formats begins. This process gives the new files names that appear in Studio.
Often, course teams prefer to identify the files with different names, which
requires the file name to be changed where it is stored in the YouTube channel.

You can give a member of the course team management access to the channel in a
process that is similar to :ref:`establishing access to the YouTube
account<Establish Access to YouTube Account>`. You obtain the email addresses
of one or more of the course team members and invite them to manage the
channel. Channel managers can only make changes to files in the channels that
they can access.

#. Follow steps 1-6 for :ref:`locating a YouTube channel ID<Locate the YouTube
   Channel ID>` to log in to the YouTube Creator Studio and access a channel's
   settings.

#. On the Account Settings Overview page, click **Add or remove managers**. A
   list of the current channel managers appears.

#. Click **Add managers**. A popup opens.

#. Supply the email address of a course team member.

#. Verify that the **Manager** option appears at lower left.

#. Click **Invite**. An activation message is sent to the email address.

#. Advise the course team member to expect and respond to the email message so
   that the account is activated. Activation must be complete for management
   access to be granted. 

   See steps 4-5 for :ref:`establishing access to a YouTube account<Establish
   Access to YouTube Account>`.
